                <p>[Page last updated on DD/MM/YYYY]</p>
                <p>These terms and conditions apply to candidates who are registered
                  for the purposes of searching for apprenticeship vacancies on
                  GOV.UK</p>
                <p>The terms and conditions explain how we use information and the
                  steps we take to provide a safe website.</p>
                <p>1. Data Protection Act 1998</p>
                <p>The Skills Funding Agency (SFA) is registered with the Information
                  Commissioner’s Office (ICO) which is responsible for the Data
                  Protection and Freedom of Information Acts. Our notification
                  can be seen on the ICO website http://www.ico.gov.uk/</p>
                <p>You’ve certain rights over the information you provide. These rights
                  are under the Data Protection Act 1998. Personal information
                  from users is only collected if given to us.</p>
                <p>The system isn’t intended to attract children under the age of
                  14 and the SFA doesn’t knowingly ask or send them requests for
                  personal information.</p>
                <p>2. Use of personal information</p>
                <p>a) The vacancies system allows individuals to apply for apprenticeships
                  and be kept informed of apprenticeship opportunities.</p>
                <p>It also allows the National Careers Service (NCS) and its employees
                  or agents to search for apprenticeship vacancies and pass details
                  to clients for the purpose of providing careers advice and guidance.</p>
                <p>Personal information obtained will be provided to learning providers
                  and employers only to match candidates to possible apprenticeship
                  vacancies, including those employers or providers offering a
                  guaranteed interview scheme. Learning providers may act on behalf
                  of employers to shortlist candidates for interview.</p>
                <p>b) In addition, information will be used for the following purposes:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>dealing with enquiries and responding to helpline requests</li>
                  <li>helping candidates use the vacancies system</li>
                  <li>assisting organisations in supporting candidates</li>
                  <li>notifying candidates of changes to the system</li>
                  <li>informing candidates of vacancies that may be of interest</li>
                </ul>
                <p>c) The information provided in the ‘My areas of interest’ section
                  and a candidate’s ‘favourite searches’ will be held and only
                  used to identify potential areas of demand by the SFA. It won’t
                  be passed on to any third party.</p>
                <p>d) Research and partner information</p>
                <p>We may share statistics about website visitors, content, traffic
                  patterns and other related information with reputable third parties.</p>
                <p>User data will be shared with partner organisations, and their
                  employees and agents, to support the candidate in the search
                  and application process.</p>
                <p>Personal information relating to users or administrators may be
                  used for administration and research purposes.</p>
                <p>e) Additional uses</p>
                <p>Personal information may be held by the SFA, or by any successors,
                  for the purposes described above.</p>
                <p>f) Duration of candidate data held and deleting your account</p>
                <p>The system will check for inactive accounts as part of its system
                  performance. Candidates who have completed the registration process
                  but haven’t logged on for 12 months will be deleted. In addition,
                  candidates who started the registration process but haven’t activated
                  their account within 30 days will also be deleted. In both cases
                  the candidate’s personal details will be removed, and they’ll
                  be required to re-register to use the system.</p>
                <p>Candidates can also remove their details in accordance with the
                  Data Protection Act 1998 by deleting their account through their
                  ‘My Profile’ menu or by contacting the National Helpdesk at nationalhelpdesk@apprenticeships.gov.uk.
                  This will remove all personal details and the account will be
                  deleted. The candidate will need to re-register to use the system.</p>
                <p>g) Improper use and data held</p>
                <p>The SFA reserves the right to delete candidate accounts that make
                  use of inappropriate personal information, including email addresses
                  and usernames.</p>
                <p>The SFA shall pass on to third parties personal information of
                  candidates, learning providers, and employers or personal information
                  obtained from the system for the purpose of investigating any
                  illegal or improper use or behaviour. The SFA will also disclose
                  personal information, if required by law, to protect personal
                  safety, the public or the vacancies system.</p>
                <p>3. Security</p>
                <p>The SFA will use reasonable effort to ensure all personal information
                  is secure against unauthorised access.</p>
                <p>When the SFA needs to send information to third parties for the
                  purpose of providing a service to candidates, we’ll only provide
                  those third parties the information they need to deliver the
                  service, and they’re prohibited from using that information for
                  any other purpose.</p>
                <p>The SFA isn’t responsible for the content or security of any sites
                  linked to and from the vacancies system.</p>
                <p>You’ll keep any passwords or usernames created for the purpose
                  of your use confidential and you agree not to disclose your password
                  and username to anyone else.</p>
                <p>4. Your consent</p>
                <p>By providing personal information, you consent to the use of this
                  information as described in these terms and conditions or as
                  stated at the time that such information is obtained. These terms
                  and conditions may be changed, modified or amended. Any changes
                  will be posted on this page. Your continued use of the vacancies
                  system following the posting of any changes to the terms and
                  conditions will mean you’ve accepted those changes.</p>
                <p>5. Service provision and data</p>
                <p>The vacancies system is intended to be available 7 days a week,
                  24 hours a day, subject to planned maintenance slots. The SFA
                  won’t be liable for any failure to achieve this level of availability.</p>
                <p>The system may be suspended without notice for maintenance or repair
                  and for system failure or reasons beyond our control.</p>
                <p>The SFA will endeavour to exclude viruses from the system and data
                  but can’t guarantee this. The user should take appropriate steps
                  in respect of any such risk from virus attack.</p>
                <p>The SFA isn’t responsible for the content of external sites that
                  link to the system or which are linked from it. It has no control
                  over the availability of linked pages and can’t guarantee these
                  links will always work. The system and data are for general information
                  purposes only. Although the SFA has made reasonable efforts to
                  ensure information on the vacancies system is as full and accurate
                  as possible, it doesn’t claim the data is fully comprehensive
                  or accurate.</p>
                <p>6. Limitation of liability</p>
                <p>The SFA accepts no liability in contract, tort or otherwise including
                  negligence for:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>loss of access due to routine and emergency maintenance or excessive
